Project: Istaqim

In this project, I was responsible for the artificial intelligence part of the Istaqim application, which aims to help Muslims correct their prayer.

Details of the work:
Video Analysis using AI:

I developed the system that analyzes the videos uploaded by users for their prayer performance.

Computer vision techniques were used to detect the movements during the prayer (like bowing and prostration) and compare the user’s performance with the ideal performance.

Error Detection:

I developed error detection algorithms for the prayer movements using artificial intelligence.

These algorithms identify whether the movements are performed correctly or if there are any errors that need correction.

Error Correction:

After detecting errors, I developed a suggestion system to guide users in correcting their movements, helping them improve their performance based on accurate analysis.

Machine Learning:

Machine learning techniques were applied to improve the accuracy of movement analysis over time, enhancing the app’s ability to recognize movements in various scenarios.

Technologies used:
OpenCV and TensorFlow: for implementing computer vision and machine learning techniques.

Python: for developing the algorithms related to analysis and correction.

This role was pivotal in enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of the app in providing precise and helpful corrections for users.

YOLO Algorithm Usage:
In the project, I used the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm as part of the AI system to detect and track movements during prayer with high precision.

Object Recognition:

YOLO was used to detect objects in the videos uploaded by users, such as hands, knees, and prostrations, by analyzing each frame quickly and accurately.

Movement Time Analysis:

I applied YOLO to monitor real-time movements during the prayer, helping identify errors and ensuring that the movements are executed correctly.

Performance Enhancement:

Thanks to the speed of the YOLO algorithm, we were able to process videos in real-time while maintaining high accuracy in error detection.

Integration with Other Algorithms:

The YOLO algorithm was integrated with other recognition algorithms to provide a comprehensive report on prayer performance and analyze movements thoroughly.

This use of the YOLO algorithm was a crucial component in enabling the application to offer an interactive and real-time experience for its users.
