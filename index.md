  <h3>Istaqim Project - Artificial Intelligence</h3>
  <p>In this project, I was responsible for the **artificial intelligence** part of the **Istaqim** application, which aims to help Muslims correct their prayer. I used techniques such as computer vision and **YOLO** to analyze and correct movements during the prayer.</p>
  
  <h4>Technologies Used:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>OpenCV and TensorFlow for analyzing videos using artificial intelligence.</li>
    <li>Error detection and correction algorithms based on AI.</li>
    <li>**YOLO** algorithm for real-time movement detection.</li>
  </ul>
